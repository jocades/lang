  // strings are just arrays of characters

  // char str[] is an array of characters that is allocated on the stack
  // and we can't change the size of the array after it is created
  // char* str is a pointer to a character that is allocated on the stack
  // and we can change the pointer to point to a different memory location
  // but we can't change the size of the string
  // we can't change the characters in the string because they are stored in
  // read-only memory

  // we can access the characters in the string using the same pointer
  // arithmetic

  // allocating memory and freeing it
  // malloc() allocates memory on the heap and returns a pointer to it
  // free() deallocates the memory
  // we need to include stdlib.h for malloc() and free()
  // to create a struct we need to use malloc() to allocate memory for it
  struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;

  free(point);
  // we can still access the memory but it will contain garbage
  printf("point->x: %d\n", point->x);
  printf("point->y: %d\n", point->y);

  // when should we use malloc()?
  // when we need to allocate memory on the heap
  // when should we use free()?
  // when we are done with the memory and we want to deallocate it
  // we can use that memory for something else
  // what happens if we don't use free()?
  // the memory will be leaked and we will run out of memory
  // if we keep allocating memory and not freeing it
  // we can use valgrind to check for memory leaks
  // valgrind --leak-check=full ./a.out

  // casting
  // we can cast a pointer to a different type
  // but why and when should we do that?
  // when we need to access the memory as a different type
  // for example, we have a pointer to an integer but we need to access it as a
  // character we can cast the pointer to a character pointer
  int b = 65;
  int* pb = &b;
  char* pc = (char*)pb;
  printf("b: %d\n", b);
  printf("*pb: %d\n", *pb);
  printf("*pc: %c\n", *pc);

  // we can also cast a pointer to void pointer
  // void pointer is a generic pointer that can point to any type
  // but we can't dereference it directly
  // we need to cast it to the correct type before dereferencing it
  void* pv = pb;
  printf("*pv: %d\n", *(int*)pv);
